Giskard
=======

Currently, Giskard is an R&D project aiming at getting UAVs to fly autonomously in order to accomplish given tasks.

For our first try, we're playing around with an Android app in the hope that we can attach it to the drone and let it go.


# Dependencies 

Giskard uses the javadrone project, check it out at: https://code.google.com/p/javadrone/

# Development environment

Download, install and setup Android Studio: https://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html

That should be all you need to open this project and build it. If you find this not to be true, please create an issue and will look into it.

If you'd rather use Eclipse or Sublime+CLI, good luck, you're on your own for the time being :).
